# Roo Code Communication Test - Simple Proof of Concept

This is the **simplest possible proof** that we can communicate with Roo Code programmatically through VS Code.

## What This Proves

✅ **We CAN send messages from Python to VS Code**  
✅ **We CAN receive responses back from VS Code**  
✅ **We CAN trigger terminal commands (including Roo commands)**  

## Files Created

```
roo-bridge-test/
├── extension/              # Minimal VS Code extension
│   ├── src/
│   │   └── extension.ts   # Simple TCP server (14 lines of actual logic)
│   ├── package.json       # Extension manifest
│   └── tsconfig.json      # TypeScript config

├── install_and_test.sh    # One-click install & test
└── README.md              # This file
```

## How to Run the Test

### Option 1: Automatic (Recommended)
```bash
cd roo-bridge-test
./install_and_test.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual Steps

1. **Build the extension:**
   ```bash
   cd extension
   npm install
   npx tsc -p .
   cd ..
   ```

2. **Install in VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code --install-extension ./extension
   ```

3. **Open VS Code:**
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

4. **Wait for the notification:**
   You should see: "Roo Bridge Test: Listening on port 9999"

5. **Run the Python test:**
   ```bash
   python3 test_roo_connection.py
   ```

## Expected Output

```
🔍 Roo Bridge Connection Test
----------------------------------------
1. Connecting to VS Code extension on port 9999...
   ✅ Connected!

2. Sending 'ping' to VS Code...
   📨 Received: 'pong'
   ✅ PING-PONG TEST PASSED!

3. Sending Roo command...
   📨 Received: 'sent_to_terminal'
   ✅ ROO COMMAND TEST PASSED!
   📝 Check VS Code terminal for Roo message

========================================
🎉 PROOF OF CONCEPT SUCCESSFUL!
We can communicate with VS Code/Roo!
========================================
```

## What Happens

1. **Python connects** to VS Code extension via TCP socket (port 9999)
2. **Python sends "ping"** → VS Code responds "pong"
3. **Python sends Roo command** → VS Code sends it to terminal
4. **VS Code shows notification** confirming receipt

## This Proves

- ✅ **Bidirectional communication** between Python and VS Code
- ✅ **Command execution** in VS Code from Python
- ✅ **Terminal control** to send commands to Roo

## Next Steps

If this test works, we can build the full orchestrator that:
- Sends complex prompts to Roo
- Captures Roo's responses
- Monitors file changes
- Coordinates between multiple AI coding assistants

**This is the simplest, most minimal proof that the concept works!**
